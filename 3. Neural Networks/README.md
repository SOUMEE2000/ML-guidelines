# Description of the files:
* File contains a neural network made from scratch. The intuition, theory and a little maths is included in a blogpost as a sort of **[tutorial](https://soumee2000.github.io/technical/Neural-Nets-From-Scratch/)** on my blogsite. At first the structure of simple single- layer perceptron is coded and then generalised for n- neurons and layers. It has a very good accuracy of 95.55% on the [iris dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris)
