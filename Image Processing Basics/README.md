**[U-Net.ipynb](https://github.com/SOUMEE2000/Machine-Learning-Stash/blob/main/Image%20Processing%20Basics/U_Net.ipynb)**:
The U-net on the DRIVE Dataset and the results are saved in the above folder.

**[Dendritic Spine Segmentation](https://github.com/SOUMEE2000/Machine-Learning-Stash/blob/main/Image%20Processing%20Basics/%20Dendritic_spine_segmentation.ipynb)**: Transfer Learning was applied. The same DRIVE Dataset was modified a bit(the images were negated to suit the needs of another dataset where the objects were of high intensity and background was of low intensity) and trained on the same UNet to segment out the dendritic spines from the different dataset.
