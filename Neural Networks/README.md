# Description of the files:
* File contains a neural network made from scratch. The intuition, theory and a little maths will be included in a blogpost as a sort of tutorial that I intend to publish soon. 
At first the structure of simple single- layer perceptron is coded and then generalised for n- neurons and layers. It has a very good accuracy of 95.55% on the [iris dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris)
