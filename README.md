# Sentiment Analysis

Ideas collected from some blogs, sites and other cool resources available on the internet that got me started in sentiment analysis as well as
some of the results I found while playing around with these NLP tools. **The inspiration for each of those notebooks are mentioned as source
in the notebooks.** Trying to recreate these notebooks would be helpful for anyone interested. Constructive criticism is also welcome.

## Description:
Tried to apply my knowledge on the IMDB review dataset for sentiment analysis:

File-1: How even different vectorisers affect the accuracy of data

File-2: How the different models in Scikit-learn affect the accuracy of predictions

File-3: How ensemble models increase accuracy

File-4: Current methods like LSTM and deep learning(how they affect accuracy)

The Dataset used is here

To upload the dataset on google colab:

Change the runtime to GPU in colab for better performance.
